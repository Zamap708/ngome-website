Thank\n                        you for your openness in responding to the Holy Spirit’s invitation to visit this Sanctuary of\n                        Grace, Healing and Prayer. May our eternal and ever-loving God, through the intercession of\n                        our Heavenly Mother, Tabernacle of the Most High, reward you for all the efforts you make\n                        to come to Ngome. As we would like your stay at the Ngome Sanctuary (Shrine) to be as\n                        pleasant and helpful as possible, we are providing you with some recommendations, and ask\n                        you sincerely to read them carefully and to abide by them.\n                        \n                        The Shrine is closed to visits and Pilgrimages during the Easter celebrations of Holy Week\n                        (05-14 April 2023) and Christmas (16-30 December 2023).\n                        \n                        1. Holy Mass is celebrated only in the Chapel on the Rock and the Parish Church. It is ONLY\n                        possible to celebrate Holy Mass at the Springs, with prior permission of the Rector. At VERY\n                        special celebrations Holy Mass will be celebrated in front of the Parish Church for extra-\n                        ordinarily large congregations. For all pilgrimages, the priest who would be the main\n                        celebrant at a Holy Mass at Ngome is expected to confirm this ministry with the Rector\n                        before arriving at the Shrine. The largest group that is accommodated at Ngome will\n                        ALWAYS be given the first preference to have the priest/s who accompanies them to be the\n                        MAIN CELEBRANT and/or PREACHER at the Mass.\n                        \n                        2. All priests are invited to concelebrate during the Holy Mass. Priests who accompany day\n                        groups are also asked to concelebrate during the Mass. Mass times are as follows:\n                        - 11h00 Saturday morning Mass in English or the vernacular of the congregation\n                        - 07h00 Sunday morning Mass in English or the vernacular of the congregation\n                        - 07h30 Monday morning Mass in English or Zulu or the vernacular of the congregation\n                        - 07h00 Tuesday to Thursday weekday morning Masses in English or the vernacular of the\n                        congregation\n                        - 17h30 Friday weekday evening Masses in English or the vernacular of the congregation\n                        \n                        Those priests who wish to be the Main Celebrant and/or preach at Mass need to make prior\n                        arrangements with the Rector. All Celebrants are expected to wear an Alb, Stole and\n                        Chasuble (Chasuble and Stoles for Holy Mass will be provided by the Shrine). Bring what is\n                        necessary (Alb, celebration booklet...), and if you have permission from your local ordinary\n                        to hear Confessions - to be at the disposal of pilgrims for Confessions in your language, or in\n                        the language you speak. For those wishing to join the Parish Mass, it is celebrated on Sunday\n                        morning at 10h00 in Zulu (English may also be used for English speaking congregants).\n                        \n                        3. All priests (and Oblate Brothers) working in the Sanctuary have permission to meet\n                        pilgrim groups and give conferences or talks. All visiting priests who accompany pilgrims\n                        have to obtain permission from the Rector to present any talks.\n                        \n                        4. No one, except the commissioned clergy, has the permission to ","pray over":" any person\n                        either in or around the Church area or at the Place of the Seven Springs. Prayer meetings and\n                        gatherings in the sanctuary can be organised only with the permission of the Rector.\n                        \n                        5. For a group or a family to visit the Shrine, all leaders of these pilgrim groups are expected\n                        to make prior bookings in order to secure this visit, this includes day and night visiting\n                        groups. This process will ensure that the infrastructure of the Shrine may be able to cope with\n                        the number of pilgrims visiting at any given time. Leaders of pilgrim groups together with the\n                        accompanying priest(s) must meet with the Rector and/or Assistant Rectors upon arrival at\n                        the Shrine to discuss the final programme for their stay. Leaders of pilgrim groups must\n                        arrange their meetings with priests or guest speakers at the Sanctuary with the Rector before\n                        arrival at the Shrine. Leaders should also arrange to meet with the Rector or Assistant Rector\n                        to prepare for the Holy Mass(es). Music should be carefully chosen according to the liturgical\n                        norms of the Church, and those proclaiming the Word should be suitably prepared. Those in\n                        charge of the worship must meet with the Rector or his Assistant Rector before Holy Mass to\n                        finalise the liturgy to be used during the worship.\n                        \n                        6. Pilgrimage group-leaders should book the accommodation for their group providing the\n                        intended number of pilgrims. The number of males, females and children should be specified\n                        for bed allocations. This should be done via email to ngomemarianshrine@gmail.com. Your\n                        booking request will be approved via email from the Shrine. The leader of the group will then\n                        confirm, via email, this agreed booking date. The booking is then considered as a\n                        TENTATIVE booking until the non-refundable 30% deposit is paid. If the deposit is not\n                        transacted a months before the arrival date of the group, the booking date will be given over\n                        to another group. This is necessary as there are untimely last-minute cancellations which\n                        make it impossible for those desperately wanting to visit the Sanctuary to make their\n                        bookings at any shorter notice. Two weeks before the arrival of each group the outstanding\n                        payment needs to be made into the shrine bank account. Families may also book as some\n                        rooms have been setup for this purpose (this is not always possible when the Shrine is very\n                        full). Single individuals or small groups may also book even if they are not part of an\n                        \n                        officially organized pilgrimage group. Refer to the Accommodation tab / document at the\n                        top of this web page for more details.\n                        \n                        7. You are asked NOT to make any other arrangements during the prayer on Saturday\n                        evenings between 18h30-22h00. No other liturgies or prayer activities are allowed during this\n                        time at the Shrine. Instead it is a period of Communal Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament\n                        and Healing Service for everyone. The Rector and/or Assistants will preside at this liturgy\n                        and lead the singing. All groups should be seated by the Chapel at least by 18h15.\n                        \n                        8. The area around the Chapels and Church, the Madonna Grotto, the Place of the Seven\n                        Springs, and the Stations of the Cross, are all places of prayer. We ask you to please respect\n                        them as such, to behave in harmony with their significance and to dress appropriately so as\n                        not to disturb the prayer and meditation of other pilgrims. No eating or drinking is allowed in\n                        the church and chapels. We ask you to preserve the cleanliness of all these places. Toilet\n                        facilities and litter bins have been provided. The TOILETS can be found in the main\n                        dormitory and flat for those pilgrims who have booked accommodation. Other toilets are\n                        available in the ablution facility next to the school for day-pilgrims and night-pilgrims.\n                        \n                        9. No candles are to be lit in the Original Chapel of Apparition, at the Place of the Seven\n                        Springs, in the Parish Church or at the Madonna Grotto. They may be lit in the Chapel on the\n                        Rock at the candle-stand provided. Votive offerings (money), religious articles, or photos\n                        should not be left at the Original Chapel of Apparition or at the Place of the Seven Springs.\n                        These may be dropped into the petition boxes in the Chapel on the Rock or the Parish\n                        Church.\n                        \n                        10. Smoking is not allowed in or around the special places of prayer. Those wishing to smoke\n                        may do so behind the main dormitory accommodation for pilgrims or behind the dining hall.\n                        \n                        11. Those who wish to collect water from the Place of the Seven Springs may do so with\n                        containers no larger than 10 litres. 25 LITRE CONTAINERS OR LARGER ONES ARE\n                        NOT ALLOWED TO BE USED AT NGOME. The Local children are not allowed to carry\n                        the containers for pilgrims.\n                        \n                        12. It is forbidden to solicit any money, apart from the offerings during Holy Mass. It is thus\n                        forbidden for any individual or group to sell Sacramental items or oils at the Shrine. All\n                        Sacramental items are sold at the Shrine Repository. Special collection boxes are to be used\n                        for the collection during Holy Mass. If anyone tries to solicit money from you for any other\n                        purpose, please contact the Rector. Boxes are available in the Chapel on the Rock and the\n                        Parish Church in front of the altar for personal petitions.\n                        \n                        13. OILS for use during prayer or devotions are not to be given out or sold to the laity…BY\n                        DECREE OF THE DIOCESAN BISHOP. Use of oils is strictly the domain of the ordained\n                        clergy in the Catholic Church. At Ngome, the Sacrament of the Sick may be administered\n                        according to the liturgical norms, i.e. outside of Holy Mass.\n                        14. We ask that Mass intentions, pledges or donations for the maintenance of the Sanctuary\n                        of Our Mother, Tabernacle of the Most High, be given to the Rector or Assistant Rector or\n                        dropped into the boxes at collection time during Holy Mass.\n                        \n                        15. PLEASE DO NOT DRIVE AT NIGHT TO NGOME UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN\n                        HERE BEFORE...YOU WILL GET LOST IN THE MOUNTAINS ESPECIALLY IF\n                        THERE’S MIST AND RAIN.\n                        \n                        16. We trust that the focus of your pilgrimage will be to spend time in prayer with the\n                        Eucharistic Lord who has invited us to worship and adore God through the kindness of his\n                        Mother, Mary Tabernacle of the Most High.

Now that you intend to come on Pilgrimage to our Place of Prayer and Grace, it would be your responsibility to bring your sisters and brothers here to our Lord in the Holy Eucharist and to his Mother.\n\nThe following guidelines will help you make a good pilgrimage:\n\n1. All bookings for Parishes or Sodality/Bible Study/Prayer/Ministry groups must be done with the approval of your Parish Priest. An email from the Parish Priest will suffice for approval. Bookings for families do not need the approval of the parish priest.\n\n2. NB: If a PARISH GROUP (60 OR MORE PEOPLE) has made a booking for accommodation in the year, a second group from that parish WILL not be considered for a weekend booking for accommodation in that same year. This is due to the great demand from the many parishes in Southern Africa who wish to visit the Shrine. However, a second group from that same PARISH MAY ONLY be considered for a pilgrimage during the weekdays of the same year, if the demand for bookings allows it.\n\n3. All bookings/changes or cancellations must be done either by fax or email. We do not except bookings/changes or cancellations via a telephone call.\n\n4. All cancellations must be done at least 30 days in advance. Children under 12 years pay half price. Bookings should be done via fax or email. Your booking request will be approved via email or fax from the Shrine. Once you have received approval, to confirm your booking, a 30% non-refundable deposit should be made 4 months before the date you are to arrive at Ngome. If the deposit is not paid 4 months before your group is to arrive, the booking will be given to another group to meet their urgent need. This is necessary as there are untimely last-minute cancellations which make it impossible for those desperately wanting to visit the Sanctuary to make their bookings at any shorter notice. Families may also book as some rooms have been setup for this purpose (This is not always possible when the Shrine is fully booked). Individuals or small groups may also book even if they are not part of an officially organized pilgrimage group.\n\n5. You are expected to pay the full amount for accommodation and meals at Ngome. Religious Sisters, Brothers and Priests are not expected to pay, but they may make a contribution if they are able to help with costs incurred. If the deposit is not paid 4 months prior to your arrival the booking will be given to another group. The total number of pilgrims the Shrine will allow you to book includes priests, religious & drivers. Please do not add extra numbers for the priests, religious and the drivers of your vehicles.\n\n6. Cheque payments are to be made out to 'Ngome Marian Shrine'. If you have paid directly into our account (ABSA Vryheid, Account Name: Ngome Marian Shrine, Account Number: 712 496 681) in advance, please provide us with a proof of payment. This can be done by emailing: shrine@ngome.co.za (use a copy of the bank deposit slip. Use your name or parish or group leader as a reference.\n\n7. For weekends, accommodation is available from 16h00 on Friday until 09h00 on Sunday morning.\n\n8. Accommodation is not available from Sunday midday until Monday afternoon, and on Friday during the day, as the facilities need to be cleaned. However, accommodation is available from 16h00 on Monday until 09h00 on Friday morning.\n\n9.

            "content": "Guidelines for Pilgrims attending the Night Pilgrimage (Effective Jan 2016) Dear Pilgrimage Leader(s), In the name of the Diocese of Eshowe, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate and Benedictine Sisters serving this Sanctuary, we are pleased to welcome you to Ngome. Now that you intend to come on Pilgrimage to our Place of Prayer and Grace, it would be your responsibility to bring your sisters and brothers here to our Lord in the Holy Eucharist and to his Mother. The Night Pilgrimage entails an all-night pilgrimage with no sleeping facilities provided by the Shrine. We would expect pilgrims to arrive before 6pm so as to be part of the Communal Adoration at 7pm in the evening. The following guidelines will help you make a good pilgrimage: 1. All bookings/changes or cancellations must be done either by fax or email. We do not accept bookings/changes or cancellations via a telephone call alone. 2. All cancellations must be done at least 30 days in advance. Pilgrimage group-leaders should book for their group providing the intended number of pilgrims. This should be done via fax or email. To confirm bookings, a 30% non-refundable payment should be made 2 months before the date you are to arrive at Ngome. If not your pilgrimage date may be given to another group for the urgent need. This is necessary as there are untimely last-minute cancellations which make it impossible for those desperately wanting to visit the Sanctuary to make their bookings at any shorter notice. 3. Cheque payments are to be made out to “Ngome Marian Shrine”. If you have paid directly into our account (ABSA Vryheid, Account Name: Ngome Marian Shrine, Account Number: 712 496 681) in advance, please provide us with a proof of payment. This can be done either by emailing (shrine@ngome.co.za) or faxing (034 967 9120) us a copy of the bank deposit slip. 4. Tarrifs for Night Pilgrims: Per Bus per night R450-00 Per mini-bus per night R150-00 Per car per night R75-00 5. Please ensure that you furnish us with the name(s) and contact details of the priest(s) who will accompany you on this pilgrimage to Ngome. 6. We kindly ask Night Pilgrims to arrive before 6pm so as to be punctual for the Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament on Saturday evening at 7pm-8.30pm. No other liturgies or prayer activities are allowed at the Shrine during this time of Adoration. Instead it is a period of Communal Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament for everyone. The Rector and/or Assistant Rectors will preside at this liturgy and lead in the singing. 7. Evening Mass is offered to Pilgrims at 22h00. Please ensure that you confirm this change with the Rector. The Rector and/or Assistant Rectors will concelebrate during this Mass. We also ask that pilgrims come to Ngome accompanied by a priest(s). Please refer to the “Guidelines and Information for Pilgrims” document when drawing up a Programme for your stay at our Sanctuary. Your Programme should be forwarded to us via fax or email so that we may fully meet your needs. PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOUR PILGRIM GROUP IS AWARE OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION WHEN THEY BOOK. We thank you for your prayerful cooperation and ask our Lord Jesus Christ and his Mother to bless your pilgrimage abundantly. In the Lord Jesus Christ and Mary Immaculate. Fr Wayne Weldschidt OMI Fr Nkululeko Meyiwa OMI Fr Andrew Knott OMI Rector Assistant Rector Assistant Rector"

        Ngome Marian Shrine
        </h1>
        <p className="page-content">
          Ngome Marian Shrine exudes the quintessence of Our Lady, Mother of Christ. A sanctuary of life in all its natural, Divine beauty, simple and humble in character, yet powerful and gentle all at once. From whence flows pure, life-giving water and the Love of the Most Blessed Trinity emanates and resonates from every living thing, this is indeed Holy Ground. Positioned above lush forest where the quiet streams have formed a pool and God’s creatures hum and buzz, a wooden Cross and benches are found near the waters edge supporting a prayerful and meditative mood. The captivating backdrop of the Chapel brings peace and comfort to pilgrims encouraging a deep connection with God. Looking out at the panoramic view surrounding the Shrine, one cannot help but be perfectly awe-inspired by the absolute Love and Mercy of our God, the Creator. <br /><br />
  
          Testimonies of miracles, healing and supernatural events are not uncommon here at Ngome and pilgrims depart filled with Jesus and the love and blessings of Our Holy Mother. <br /><br />
    
          Mary, Our Mother, calls us to conversion, repentance and prayer and assists us, through Her powerful intercession, in all our afflictions and necessities, in making straight the way for the Lord. <br /><br />
    
          Mary, Tabernacle of the Most High calls you to Ngome. Come and be refreshed. <br />
          Join Her in Adoration of Her Divine Son, The Most High, Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. Entrust yourself to Her loving guidance and protection so that one day we can Behold the King in all His Glory and join Her, together with all the Angels and Saints in singing the unending hymn of praise: Glory and Praise to Our God! All Glory, Praise and Honour be to God, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit!’ forever and ever. <br /><br />
    
          God has exulted the lowly creature and crowned Her Queen of Heaven and Earth. <br /><br />
    
          Mary, Tabernacle of the Most High, pray for us. <br />
          O Mary conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to Thee. <br />
          Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen
